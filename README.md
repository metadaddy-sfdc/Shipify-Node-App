## About
This application is a sample Shipment Fulfillment app called 'Shipify' that acts as a proof of concept for a warehouse shipping app. The application is intended to integrate with Force.com and surface itself in Salesforce using Force.com Canvas. This application takes in the Signed Request sent from Salesforce, and then the applicaiton unsigns it and grabs the context of the user and org information in order to perform its interactions (with user context) with Salesforce.
